# 👋 Hey there! I'm Aman Kumar Rawat
🧠 Part-time human, full-time data enthusiast.
### 🤹‍♂️ Who am I?

I'm the guy who can debug your code, predict your next move with a machine learning model, and explain how a turbocharger works — all before the coffee kicks in ☕.

While some people choose one degree for fun, I said *why not two?* So now I’m decoding V8 engines by day and decoding data by night.
🚗 B.Tech in Automobile Engineering @ MMMUT, Gorakhpur  
📊 B.S. in Data Science @ IIT Madras  
### 🔍 What do I do?

- I turn **raw data** into **refined insights** – kind of like how crude oil becomes jet fuel (yes, I like engines).
- I love building **cool projects** that mix logic, creativity, and a sprinkle of memes.
- I’m on a mission to **make data talk**, and maybe crack a joke while doing it.

### 😎 Fun Facts:

- I still think “print(‘Hello World’)” is satisfying.
- I use scatter plots to settle arguments.
- If I had a rupee for every time someone said “Data is the new oil,” I’d have enough to fund my startup.
